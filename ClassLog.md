Stephen - Look at my notes.  See what to do next.  Probably will clarify what the "learning levels are".
  - Figure out / solve the "dispatcher is null" error so that data perisist across page loads.

Brian - Review code. Continue deleting scenario section.  (Contracting scope.)
  - Functionality of buttons, get some to work 

Micah - Replace number references with word reference, because the number references prevent me from changing the order of my cards
  - Clean up data.  Remove long ones.

Nathan - Get rid of the bullets on the list of questions and start on adding in the fill in the blank questions
  - Need to create new component for rendering fill in the blank questions 

Randall - Right now, I'm trying to figure out how to create functional radio buttons/selectors. At the moment, it's doing something weird where the text doesn't show up right next to the button, but rather underneath.
  - Getting group of radio buttons to behave normally -- e.g. one selected at a time.  Not quite blocked yet?

Joshua - Edit Game Manager script and create setters for scoreboard variables. Make the setters have a max value that can be obtained.
  - I want to change up my scenario UI so that I can go through all 3 scenarios without having to exit and re-enter the UI 

Robert - review my code, and try to make a multiple choice quiz
  - Making some questions multiple choice
