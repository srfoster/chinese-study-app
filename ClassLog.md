Stephen - Look at my notes.  See what to do next.  Probably will clarify what the "learning levels are".
  - Figure out / solve the "dispatcher is null" error so that data perisist across page loads.
  - [Clarify learning level sliders] Comment code it, debug, custom message depending on learning level

Brian - Review code. Continue deleting scenario section.  (Contracting scope.)
  - Functionality of buttons, get some to work 
  - Cooler backgrounds?
  - I made the buttons work and I got the score thing fixed yesterday after class.  I have a thing I am trying to make where the background changes due to how your score is.  The worse you do the worse the business in the background looks.
  - Update background image

Micah - Replace number references with word reference, because the number references prevent me from changing the order of my cards
  - Clean up data.  Remove long ones.
  - Upload clean data to glitch / add scoring 
  - Replace my correct/incorrect alert with a different method of relaying information (Recommendation: MUI's Dialog, Modal, SnackBar, Drawer)
  Add score counter

Nathan - Get rid of the bullets on the list of questions and start on adding in the fill in the blank questions
  - Need to create new component for rendering fill in the blank questions 
  - Render hello world card when MCQ comes up
  - Im hoping to just be able to display the fill in the blank questions on a serperate card just to know its working
  - refactor some code and try to add css

Randall - Right now, I'm trying to figure out how to create functional radio buttons/selectors. At the moment, it's doing something weird where the text doesn't show up right next to the button, but rather underneath.
  - Getting group of radio buttons to behave normally -- e.g. one selected at a time.  Not quite blocked yet?
  - [Correct answer detection] Console log when they select an answer
  - Don't know how to word this, but what I hope to do is figure out how to get the radio buttons to "map" to one of my JSON items. Then, do something like a "if this === answer, then return 'Correct answer.'"
  - My answer check is semi-working. It says it correctly in the console logs, but I can't quite figure out the JSX piece of it.

Joshua - Edit Game Manager script and create setters for scoreboard variables. Make the setters have a max value that can be obtained.
  - I want to change up my scenario UI so that I can go through all 3 scenarios without having to exit and re-enter the UI 
  - Attempt to optimize the scenario ui code I made yesterday
  - Add a pop in effect for my UI

Robert - review my code, and try to make a multiple choice quiz
  - (Not yet done) Making some questions multiple choice
    - Pay off some technical debt == Refactor to make code easier to maintain
    - I will refactor my code and commit it to git hub
    - try to capture and track the scores on my app

Ben - Fixing the functionality of my checkboxes so that the code can check if it is correct
  - I am going to combine my explanation button with the check answer button and make it so that button is no longer able to be clicked after done once
