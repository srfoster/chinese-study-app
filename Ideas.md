Things to keep in mind (guiding principles):
* For you:      Demo things that would be useful in YOUR projects
  - Shuffling cards
  - Sort cards by learning level
* For me:       Make an app that helps me study Chinese 
  - Make me/user type in the chinese (and check if correct)
  - Persist the data after page refresh
* For others:   Incorporate ASL in addition to Chinese


* UX (before letting other people use it):
  - Clarify what the slider is for and what "learning levels" mean

* Expand app idea into other video-based language learning domains: e.g. ASL.
