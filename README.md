TODO:
* User Story #1 (Basic studying) is complete. What to do next?
  * Clarify the Learning Level Slider
* Demo features to help class with their projects
  - Make me/user type in the chinese (and check if correct)
     - TODO: This is rough.  Improve it.
  - Also, do I currently need these features for my project?  (If not, hide them somewhere for later.)
