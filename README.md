TODO:
* User story #1: User can study their cards
   User loads the page.  The first thing they see is the first card.  Next to the card are the Basic Controls (Set "Learning Level" (0-5), Next card, Previous card).  User plays the video several times (as many times as necessary for their current learning level).  Then the user either adjusts the card's Learning Level and/or moves to the next card (Next Card button).  When they click the Next or Previous Card buttons, the appropriate card shows up, and the story repeats.
     * Put a next card button next to the card (and make it go to the next card)
        * Bug: Fix the fact that pressing Prev/Next errors out when you go too low or too high
     * Put a Learning Level Slider next to the card.  And when the user sets the level, it should be saved (persists across page loads)
       - Make slider vertical
       - ??
     * TODO: Other tasks?
