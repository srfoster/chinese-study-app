# chinese-study-app

TODO:
* Demo features to help class with their projects
  - Make me/user type in the chinese (and check if correct)
     - TODO: This is rough.  Improve it.

* User story #1: User can study their cards
   User loads the page.  The first thing they see is the first card.  Next to the card are the Basic Controls (Set "Learning Level" (0-5), Next card, Previous card).  User plays the video several times (as many times as necessary for their current learning level).  Then the user either adjusts the card's Learning Level and/or moves to the next card (Next Card button).  When they click the Next or Previous Card buttons, the appropriate card shows up, and the story repeats.
     * Put a Learning Level Slider next to the card.  And when the user sets the level, it should be saved (persists across page loads)
        - TODO: Make data persistent
